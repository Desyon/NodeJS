# Calendar App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Desyon/NodeJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Desyon/NodeJS)

This is a simple app including a server on NodeJS and a Angular based WebApp communication over a REST API. This project is for studying purposes.

## Installation
These steps must be followed to install and run the app and be able to use all tools 
such as gulp or eslint:
1. Run ``npm install --global gulp-cli``. If you have it already installed this is not 
necessary.

2. Run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies of the project. 

3. Now the server can be started any time using the command ``npm start``
